# ERS_pygame

This is a variation on the card game Egyption Rat Screw. Rather than "slapping" a stack
of cards the player presses the space bar when a pattern occurs. Patterns include repeated
cards (i.e. Jack, Jack), sandwiches (i.e. Queen, Jack, Queen), and sums of 10 (i.e. four
then six).

To play the game run ers.py.

Have fun practicing Egyption Rat Screw!
